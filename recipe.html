    <h1>MY FAVORITE NIGERIAN SOUP RECIPE(BANGA SOUP)</h1>
    <section>
    <h2>About Banga Soup</h2>
    <p>
      Soup and stews are a significant component of African cuisine and we have
      a whole lot of them. Banga soup also called <b> Palm nut soup</b>, is a soup
      prepared from palm fruit and it originated from the Niger Delta region of
      Nigeria. It is a special delicacy, particularly among the <em>Urhobo</em> and
      <em>Itsekiri</em> people of Delta State, and has become popular throughout
      Nigeria and West Africa. </p>
      <p>Banga soup is not only popular in Nigeria, but it's also a delicacy in Ghana and Cameroon.
In Ghana, palm nut soup is called <b>Abenkwan</b>. In Cameroon, it's known as <b>Mbanga.</b> While in Nigeria, it is called <b>Banga soup</b>, with variant names such as ofe akwu, oghwo amiedi, or izuwo ibiedi depending on the tribe, the ingredients used, and the mode of preparation. </p>
      <p>Today, we will be preparing banga soup
      the way it is done by the Urhobo people of Delta state. Banga soup is
      traditionally eaten with <b>"swallow"</b> like starch, fufu, eba or pounded yam.
